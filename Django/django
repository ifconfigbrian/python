django follows the MVT design pattern
   M---Model-this is the data you want to present,often data from a database
   
      V---View-a request handler that returns the relevant template and content
      
         T---Template-a text file/HTML that contains logic on how to display the data
         
ORM(object relational mapping)--is a technique that allows you to interact with your database using your python code instead of writing raw SQL queries

models are python classes that represent database tables
models are usually located in models.py file

A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments,imports relevant models and finds out what data to send to the template and returns the final result
views are located in views.py

templates are files where you describe how the result should be represented
django uses standard HTML to describe the layoutbut uses django tags to add logic
templates are found in the templates folder

when a user requests a URL django decides which view it will send it to..URLS are found in the urls.py
