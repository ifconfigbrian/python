django tells django to perform some programming logic inside the brackets

data to be displayed on the webpage should be stored in the templates folder
to make the model data available in the template,we import the Member model in the view and send it to the template

......ADDING LINKS TO DETAILS.......
   here we get more details about specific members
   we start by creating a new details.html template
   create a new view in the views.py that will deal with  incoming requests to the details url
   
  details view summary functions:
     gets the id as an argument
     uses the id to locate the correct record in the member table
     loads the details template
     creates an object containing the member
     sends the object to the template
     outputs the html that is rendered by the template
     
now the details url should point to the correct view with the id as the parameter

...............MASTER TEMPLATE.................
    you can have a parent template that you can include in all pages to do the stuff that is same in all pages
    you can include this template in the others by using the{%extends%} tag and inserting a title and content block
    
..............MAIN INDEX FILE.............
     this is the landing page when someone visits the root folder of our project
     add a view and urls then a link that wil point to the main page
     
.................404 TEMPLATE................

 gets displayed when the page you are trying to access does not exist
 when you turn debug mode to false,you have to specify the hosts you will allow the project to run from,in production this will be a proper domain name
 
.........TEST VIEW...........
   when testing different aspects,it is a good idea to have somewhere to test code without destroying the main project
   
........CREATING A USER...........
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser
   fill in all requirements in the prompts that will display and restart the server
   
.........INCLUDE MODELS..........
   to include a model in the admin interface,you have to tell django,this is done in a file called admin.py located in the apps folder
   admin.site.register(Member)
   
 you can change the list display to be more reader friendly:
  change the string representation function,__str__() of the member model
  set the list_details property of the member model
